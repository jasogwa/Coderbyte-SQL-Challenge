# Coderbyte-SQL-Challenge

MySQL version: 8.0.23

In this MySQL challenge, your query should return the information for the employee with the third highest salary. 
Write a query that will find this employee and return that row, but then replace the DivisionID column with 
the corresponding DivisionName from the table cb_companydivisions. You should also replace the ManagerID column 
with the ManagerName if the ID exists in the table and is not NULL.
